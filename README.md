## How to use ?
Note: You should make sure that all the softwares have been installed and can be used normally.
#### 1. Development Support
For the development support module, we provide two editors for specifying MetTap rules and used-defined properties as the interface for users.
We implement the development environment for MetTap rules with Xtext, an Eclipse-based tool for designing textual DSLs. 
With this tool, a domain-specific editor has some functions, such as syntax highlighting and syntax errors display. 

Step1: Create an Xtext project in Eclipse     

Step2: Modify .xtext file with the MetTap.xtext codes      

Step3: Run this project and the specific process can refer to https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation    

Step4: Write MetTap rules in the generated entity editor and they will be stored in MetTapRules.txt   

Step5: Create a Java project named MetTap in Eclipse     

Step6: Import AddNewProperty.java file      

Step7: Run this file  

Step8: Define properties in the interface, which will be stored in User-defined Properties.txt file  

#### 2. Runtime Support
For the runtime support module, we use Home Assistant to manage smart devices. 
A rule transformation component is given to translate MetTap rules into Home Assistant rules.
We integrate our runtime support module with Home Assistant (HA).
We use Home Assistant (HA) as the part of our running support platform. 
The runtime support module of our platform contains three components: device configuration which supports deployment of sensors/actuators, rule transformation which translates MetTap rules to HA rules, and execution which performs the trigger activities of specific devices.  

Step1: Create an python project in Python IDE           

Step2: Import HA.py codes      

Step3: Writing the mapping information of entity IDs and events/states, such as:entities.json, vocabularies.json   

Step4: Load MetTap rules from Rules.txt

Step5: Run Home Assistant system and this project   

Step6: Change the state of devices/sensors in Home Assistant system

Step7: If the triggers are satisfied, the action will be executed. Otherwise,it will not be executed    

Step8: Store the state datas in sensor_data.csv    

#### 3. Runtime Verification
For the runtime verification module, we provide the monitoring function to verify the properties and give feedback with verification results.
In this module, we generate monitors with MTL properties. 
These properties include the properties translated from MetTap rules automatically and user-defined ones.  


Step1: Import RV.m file into Matlab           

Step2: Enter the "deploytool" command under the command window in Matlab to open the deployment tool     

Step3: Create a new project Runtime.prj     

Step4: Select "java package" and click "ok"     

Step5: Click "add" to add a Java class named Class1    

Step6: Click "add files" to add the RV.m file   

Step7: Click "compile" to generate the Runtime.jar   

Step8: Import .java files of Runtime Verification package into MetTap project   

Step9: Reference the following two jar packages in MetTap project: Matlab installation directory\toolbox\javabuilder\jar\javabuilder.jar and Runtime.jar  

Step10: Run the Runtime_Verification.java and the rules will be verified    

#### 4. Case Study
In this section, we show how MetTap can be used to specify rules with timing constraints and verify whether applications execute correctly in home-based IoT system.  

If you want to reproduction experiment, you can load these data to test it in related procedures
