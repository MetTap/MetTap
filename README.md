## How to use ?
Note: You should make sure that all the softwares have been installed and can be used normally.
#### 1. Development Support
For the development support module, we provide two editors for specifying MetTap rules and used-defined properties as the interface for users.
We implement the development environment for MetTap rules with Xtext, an Eclipse-based tool for designing textual DSLs. 
With this tool, a domain-specific editor has some functions, such as syntax highlighting and syntax errors display.

Step1: Create an xtext project in Eclipse   
Step2: Modify .xtext file  
Step3: Run project to write MetTap rules  
#### 2. Runtime Support
For the runtime support module, we use Home Assistant to manage smart devices. 
A rule transformation component is given to translate MetTap rules into Home Assistant rules.
We integrate our runtime support module with Home Assistant (HA).
We use Home Assistant (HA) as the part of our running support platform. 
The runtime support module of our platform contains three components: device configuration which supports deployment of sensors/actuators, rule transformation which translates MetTap rules to HA rules, and execution which performs the trigger activities of specific devices.
#### 3. Runtime Verification
For the runtime verification module, we provide the monitoring function to verify the properties and give feedback with verification results.
In this module, we generate monitors with MTL properties. 
These properties include the properties translated from MetTap rules automatically and user-defined ones.
#### 4. Case Study
In this section, we show how MetTap can be used to specify rules with timing constraints and verify whether applications execute correctly in home-based IoT system.
